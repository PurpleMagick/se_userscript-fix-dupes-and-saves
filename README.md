This is a temporary fix for the issue where if you press Enter in the duplicate closure dialog, the duplicate target is added to Saves. And vice versa - adding the duplicate target to Saves *from* the duplicate dialog also submits the dialog.

For the bug report see: [Hammering a page with a dupe target where I've posted an answer or previously posted a link automatically adds dupe target to my Saves](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/421260)
